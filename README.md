# Body-Language-Decoder

## Overview
This project is a real-time body language classifier that uses a webcam feed to detect and classify different body gestures. It employs the Mediapipe library for pose detection and scikit-learn for training a machine learning model to recognize and predict body language.

## Features
Real-time Detection: Utilizes the webcam feed to detect and classify body language gestures.
Multiple Gestures: Recognizes various body gestures such as hand movements, facial expressions, and posture.
Customizable Training: Provides functionality to collect data and train a custom machine learning model based on specific gestures.
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed.

## Usage
Run the provided Python scripts within your preferred environment.
Interact with the webcam to observe the real-time detection and classification of body language gestures.
Customize and modify the scripts as needed for your specific use case.
